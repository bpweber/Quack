# Quack FPS

## A fast paced arena shooter inspired by the GOAT

### Currently In Development

***Note: Git LFS needs to be initialized for the game to work properly. I recommend cloning the repository using GitHub desktop***

To connect to a multiplayer server:
 - Move the ***server-ip.txt*** from the ***.quack*** folder into the main directory
 - Enter the IP address of the server you want to connect to into the file and save
 - Open the ***LaunchClient.bat*** script

To host a multiplayer server:
 - Move the ***server-ip.txt*** from the ***.quack*** folder into the main directory
 - Enter your public IP address into the file and save
 - Make sure you are port forwarded at port ***7777***
 - Share the IP with any players you want to connect and have them follow the connection steps above
 - Open the ***LaunchServer.bat*** script
 - Click ***Play*** on the main menu to start the server
 - **Note**: A black screen will be displayed while the server is running

To launch the game in standalone/singleplayer mode:
 - Open the ***LaunchHost.bat*** script
 - **Note**: Host mode is currently bugged in multiplayer, I recommend using proper client/server modes for multiplayer
